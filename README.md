This notebook implements an optimal control model to study and manage the spread of a disease. The model is based on a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that describe the population dynamics in different compartments:

S: Susceptible individuals
P: Protected individuals (e.g., through vaccination or maternal immunity)
C_A: Asymptomatic carriers
I_A: Infectious individuals
R: Recovered individuals
The objective of the model is to find the optimal control strategies, specifically vaccination and treatment rates, that minimize the number of infectious individuals over a given time horizon while considering the cost of implementing these controls.

The code uses the scipy.integrate.solve_ivp function to solve the ODE system and scipy.optimize.minimize to find the optimal control functions by minimizing a defined cost function. The cost function penalizes both the number of infectious individuals and the magnitude of the control efforts (vaccination and treatment rates).

The results of the optimization and simulation are visualized through plots showing the population dynamics in each compartment and the time evolution of the optimal vaccination and treatment rates.
